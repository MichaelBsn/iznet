Iznet is a dice game I made that will be expanded to include other features (chat box, adjustable columns/rows, statistics, coin-flipper, etc.) for the sake of overengineering this app. I'm mainly just using this React app as a personal developer sandbox.

'Iznet' is just 'Tenzi' spelled backwards, which is how I got the name. If you don't know, Tenzi is a dice game where you match all the dice and is how I got the idea to make this app.

Files in the 'old' folder are from the original version of this game. I decided to scrap them because the way i was displaying all the dice was too convoluted
